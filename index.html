                <p>My name is Christian Solorio, I graduated from the University of California, Riverside on March 20, 2020 with a Bachelor's of 
                    Science in Computer Science. I'm experienced using multiple languages and technologies but the ones I'm strongest with include 
                    C++, JavaScript, and Python as well as the technologies React.js, Node.js, and Postgres SQL. Besides this I have experience 
                    working with C#, Java, Android, Linux, embedded systems,  among others. I have a variety of skills and I'm costantly
                seeking to improve myself. There is always something new and exciting to learn.  </p>
                <p>I have a deep love for data analysis as well as databases. Data is my passion and wheter it be storing, accessing, or using 
                    machine learning to study datasets I simply love working with data. Besides this I have a growing passion for Fullstack 
                    development, front-end development is an artform and paired up with the intricacies of Back-End leaves you with incredibly
                     fun problems. To talk about myself, I love the outdoors and have a deep passion for music. The pictures I used in this
                    webpage where taken during a trip to Mexico. I love the beach and Mexico is full of amazing places that show the beauty in life.</p>
